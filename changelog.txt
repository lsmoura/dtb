* Updated for Patch 5.4.

Version 2.3.0
---

* Updated for Patch 5.0.4.
* Removed all tracked glyphs, as they've all been removed from the game.
* Moonfire and Sunfire can now coexist.
* Removed Pulverize, Thorns and Insect Swarm bars.

Version 2.2.0
---

* Updated for Patch 4.2.
* Changed COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED to the 4.2 parameters, fixing a great many things.

Version 2.1.0
---

* Updated included libraries.
* Now tracks which Eclipse procced last so you'll always know where to start.
* Balance Power icon is now always visible while specced Balance.
* Added a bar to track the duration/cooldown of Nature's Grace.
* Eclipse Power bar is now colored properly.

Version 2.0.4
---

* A new option has been added to use the Blizzard cooldown models. This gives you the
  normal "clock" animation, and allows addons such as OmniCC to apply cooldown timers.
  This option is considered beta, and probably won't work right in all cases. 
* Changed the Eclipse power icons slightly. They now show which spell you should be
  casting. IE, the Solar Eclipse icon will show when you should be casting Wrath, and
  the Lunar Eclipse icon will show when you should cast Starfire.
* The Eclipse Power bar no longer hides at 0% power.
* Starfall is now only tracked when actually talented.
* Force of Nature is no longer tracked when disabled.
* Innervate can now be found under "Other Options".
* Added bars for Thorns, Solar Beam and Pulverize.
* Mangled and Demoralized bars should now hide properly when similar debuffs expire.
* Rebirth is once again tracked properly.
* Made a number of performance optimizations. CPU usage should be a lot lower.
* Abilities like Starsurge and Rebirth should no longer have their bars "extended" by the GCD.

This addon will give you a series of timer bars for important self buffs and
debuffs. These include:

 * Faerie Fire
	As long as your target has FF up, the addon doesn't care who applied it.
 * Insect Swarm
 * Moonfire
	The Moonfire bar will show how many times Glyph of Starfire has extended
	Moonfire's duration.
 * Eclipse
	Solar Eclipse and Lunar Eclipse have separate proc bars	so you can keep
        track of them individually.
 * Eclipse Power
	Tracks your Eclipse Power level.
 * Starfall
	The Starfall bar will turn red if you're too far away from your target.
 * Starsurge
	A bar will be shown when Starsurge is on cooldown.
 * Rake
 * Rip
	The Rip bar will show how many times Glyph of Shred has extended Rip's duration.
 * Berserk
	Berserk will show a bar when it's active, and when its on cooldown.
 * Tiger's Fury
	Tiger's Fury will show a bar when it's active, and when its on cooldown.
 * Savage Roar
 * Mangled
	This bar will show whenever Mangle Bear, Mangle Cat, or Trauma is present on the target.
 * Lacerate
	Lacerate will show how many stacks are applied (ie, Lacerate x 3).
 * Demoralized
	As long as your target has one of the Attack Power debuffs present,
	you'll see the "Demoralized" bar while in Dire Bear Form. Currently
	it watches for Vindication, Demoralizing Roar, Demoralizing Shout,
	Demoralizing Screech, and Curse of Weakness.

3. FAQ
---

Q: Some bars aren't disappearing when they run out.
A: Due to a bug, the combat log occasionally stops working, which stops the addon from
   being able to see when buffs and debuffs fade. /reloadui may fix this, but you'll
   probably need to relog.

Q: Will you add bars to track Rejuvenation, Regrowth and Lifebloom?
A: Not likely. If you have 5 Rejuvenations up on a raid, it wouldn't be very useful
   to see 5 additional bars with different names on them. This kind of thing is
   better handled by your unitframes.
